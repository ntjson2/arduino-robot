# arduino-robot

## Dependencies

- Make sure these libraries are included in the head of your file. They can all be found at https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/

- <Servo.h>

- <Wire.h>

- <Adafruit_MotorShield.h>

- <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>

## Running the program

- 1. We recommend having the Arduino IDE installed for this process.
- 2. Compile the ino file
- 3. Make sure the data usb cable is attached to the Arduino and your host computer. 
- 4. Upload to the Arduino
- 5. The process then initially enters the Setup() function where most initialization occurs. This is then followed by the loop() function where the main body of code interaction runs.
